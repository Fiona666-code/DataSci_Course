As a programming language, Python can be used by a programmer to write a program that performs a task. This program can be later executed many times without being modified. But you can use Python in other ways. For instance, to examine the variation of the stock price of a specific company, or the structure of the vacation rental market in a specific region.\n",

We can call several instances of the interpreter, or **kernels**, and have them running simultaneously. To send our commands to the kernel and (eventually) get results and other messages from the kernel, we use an app as an interface. In the examples of this course, the interface is assumed to be a **notebook**, but everything can be easily transported to a different interface, *e.g*. to a **console**."
